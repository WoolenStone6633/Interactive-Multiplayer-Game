### Demo
The current version of this game is a demo to demonstrate it's potential.

## Future Plans

- Fine-tune the bouncing of the circles
- Tweak the gravity
- Allow phones to interact with the game
- Allow multiple players
- Add a QR code for easy connectivity

# Current Issues
- Runs at different speeds depending on the refresh rate of the screen
- The goal allows circles to pass through it sometimes
- The collision with the goal is sometimes not calculated correctly
